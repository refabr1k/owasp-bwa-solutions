# OWASP Broken Web Application (OWASP BWA) solutions

 Hello, I watched @NahamSec [twitch interview with @JHaddix](https://www.twitch.tv/nahamsec/videos) and got inspired to do this challenge and training. All walkthroughs and guides which I think may help anyone could be found here. 
 
## Setup
1. Download from VM [https://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/files/1.2/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/files/1.2/)
2. Using VMWare > Open a Virtual Machine > Select .vmx file
3. If prompted select 'I copied it'
4. Configure network settings to 'host only' (its vulnerable webapps and shouldn't be exposed to public unless you like to invite hackers in!)
5. Start! 

## Walkthroughs
* [WebGoat v5.4](../master/WebGoat) :bulb: there is a newer WebGoat version v8 [here](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat)
 
 
(will be updated as I go through them)
